# Agents-Intensive-Capstone-Project
StudyAlpha-Ai-Agent
⭐ StudyAlpha – AI-Powered Autonomous Learning Assistant
A modern AI system that helps students learn smarter, faster, and more efficiently.
📘 Overview
StudyAlpha is an intelligent study assistant built using autonomous AI agents. It simplifies learning by generating personalized study plans, explanations, summaries, and quizzes based on any topic the user enters.
Instead of switching between multiple tools, learners can rely on StudyAlpha to plan, teach, explain, and evaluate — all in one place.

🌟 Key Features
🔹 Smart Topic Understanding
The system analyzes the user’s query and automatically decides what type of output is needed (plan, summary, notes, quiz, or explanation).
🔹 AI Agents Working Together

Different agents perform specialized tasks:
Planner Agent – Builds structured study plans
Explainer Agent – Breaks down complex topics
Summarizer Agent – Converts long content to concise notes
Quiz Agent – Creates quizzes to test learning

🔹 Memory-Based Interactions

The app keeps track of previous topics and conversations, helping it provide better, context-aware responses over time.

🔹 Clean & Minimal Frontend

A simple interface powered by Streamlit allows users to enter topics and instantly receive AI-generated learning materials.

🧠 System Architecture

The project is organized into several modules, each with a specific purpose:
1. agents.py
Defines custom agents with unique roles and instructions, enabling autonomous behavior.
2. predictor.py
Acts as the “brain” that determines which agent is best suited to respond to the user’s input.
3. memory.py
Stores past interactions, user preferences, and learning context.
4. tools.py
Utility functions used for formatting, content processing, and supporting agent actions.
5. frontend/app.py
A user-friendly UI developed to process input, run predictions, and display results generated by the agents.
6. tests/
A testing suite ensuring reliability and correct functioning of the components.

🚀 How It Works
User enters any topic (e.g., Machine Learning Basics)
The Predictor analyzes the input
It selects the appropriate agent
The agent generates the required output
The frontend displays it neatly
The entire workflow is automated through an intelligent agent pipeline.
